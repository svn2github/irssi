Getting bored at work.. so I decided to start writing this FAQ :)

Q: Why can't I change channel topic from the topic entry widget?
A: You need to doubleclick it first, this is because the focus gets there
   too easily and I got tired of accidentally changing topic all the time :)

Q: What are the grey nicks in nicklist?
A: People who are away, this list is updated every now and then with sending
   USERHOST commands to server, no nick is updated more frequently than once
   per 5 minutes (except when doing WHO, WHOIS, etc. commands irssi
   automatically updates the list)

Q: Can I switch the channels with keyboard?
A: Yes, with Alt-1..0 for channels 1-10 and Alt-Q..P for channels 11-20 or
   Ctrl-N to next window and Ctrl-P to previous window

Q: Can I use bolds/underlines/reverses/bells/colors?
A: Sure, even while they don't get displayed in the entry line:
   Ctrl-B = bold, Ctrl-G = bell, Ctrl-- = underline, Ctrl-V = reverse,
   Ctrl-C = color

Q: What does the "Join to #channel was synced in xx secs" mean?
A: After joined to channel, irssi asks the server for channel's mode,
   who list, bans, ban exceptions and invite list (the later two only with
   servers that support it (ircnet)). After all this is got, it displays the
   sync message.

Q: Is there any way to get WHOIS (etc.) replies to be displayed in the
   current window instead of status window?
A: Just stop using the status window (take it off from preferences). But if
   you still prefer to use the status window.. nope, not possible yet, but
   it's been in TODO for a while to let the user decide what events to
   display in what windows (status, msgs, current, all).
