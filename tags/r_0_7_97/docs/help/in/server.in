@SYNTAX:server@

/SERVER ADD [-auto | -noauto] [-ircnet <ircnet>] [-host 
            <hostname>] [-cmdspeed <ms>] [-cmdmax <count>] 
            [-port <port>] <address> [<port> [<password>]]
            
     -auto: Automatically connect to server at startup (default)
     -noauto: Don't connect to server at startup
     -ircnet: Specify what IRC network this server belongs to
     -host: Specify what host name to use, if you have multiple
     -cmdspeed: Same as /SET cmd_queue_speed, see section 3.1
     -cmdmax: Same as /SET cmd_max_at_once, see section 3.1
     -port: This is pretty much like the port argument later, 
            except this can be used to modify existing server's 
            port.

/SERVER disconnects the server in active window and connects 
to the new one. It will take the same arguments as /CONNECT. 
If you prefix the address with the + character, Irssi won't 
disconnect the active server, and it will create a new window 
where the server is connected (ie. /window new hide;
/connect address)

/SERVER without any arguments displays the list of connected 
        servers.

/SERVER REMOVE <address> [<port>]

/SERVER LIST
