@SYNTAX:bind@

Keystroke can have modifiers:

Where x being either a single character, or one of the special keys:

  Backspace Delete
  Home End Prior Next
  Up Down Left Right
  Insert Return Tab

(these key specifications will some day change to be more epic-like
when I have time to implement it)

                                 specifying this)

  /BIND Alt-Z change_window 16
  /BIND -delete Alt-Y
