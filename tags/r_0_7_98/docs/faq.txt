Q: Why does irssi crash when pressing Ctrl-4?
A: Most unices are usually configured to send SIGQUIT to active process when
   Ctrl-\ is pressed. Some terminals also treat Ctrl-4 and Ctrl-\ equally, so
   Irssi will die to SIGQUIT. Two ways to fix this: change it to something 
   else with stty (stty quit undef) or in irssi /SET ignore_signals quit

Q: Where's the GUI version?
A: Read http://irssi.org/?page=about

Q: How do I easily write text to channel that starts with '/' character?
A: / /text

Q: I connected to some server which isn't responding but now irssi tries
   to connect back to it all the time! How can I stop it?
A: Two ways. The "good way" to do it is with /DISCONNECT. Check the server
   tags first with /SERVER without giving it any parameters, reconnections
   are those that have tag starting with "recon" text. So most probably you're
   going to do /DISCONNECT recon-1. The other way is to remove all the
   reconnections with /RMRECONNS, easier but may remove some connections
   you actually wanted to reconnect (if you used multiple servers..).
