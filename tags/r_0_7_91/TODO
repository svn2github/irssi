 - BUG: when dcc sending and other side aborts, irssi sometimes eats 100%
   of cpu until the send is cancelled? (I couldn't reprodure this..)

 - /msg tab completion could work better with multiple servers .. it could
   go through all the nicks who sent you message in all servers. the server
   tag would go after nick, like nick/tag. would need to fix /msg to work
   with that too.
 - /last -away could check lastlog of the messages that came after we set
   ourself away last time. /last -new could also work better .. by marking
   the line where the last /last occured, not by going through the whole
   text buffer
 - /^command would hide the output of the command. Maybe also some
   /password command so that it would ask you to type the password to
   entry line and would hide it with asterisks, good if people spy on you :)
 - commands to move channels and servers in the config list, to set the
   join/connect order of them.
 - nick/channel lists at right side of the text version of irssi. Ctrl-N
   for example could hide/show them. add mouse support for it.
 - make nick/text completion more modular so that for example you could add
   a check in fe-dcc.c to complete with file names if the line begins with
   /dcc send. also command completion would be nice. automatic command
   completion would be nice too (/win clo = /window close).
 - statusbar:
     - you can't configure it in any way!
     - move it to fe-common, make some "statusbar" signal .. maybe
       statusbar items could be printed with printformat() and statusbar
       would be just another small window? .. or maybe not exactly, but
       something like that :)
     - when starting to run out of space some items could be made smaller,
       activity for example .. make some generic flag for items to use.
 - runtime loadable modules aren't working
 - "Netjoins: nick1, nick2, nick3 .." - just as the "Netsplit quits" text
   except prints when people join back.
 - there's something wrong with netsplits. it sometimes forgets to print
   some of the nicks.
 - some problems with finding curses? in openbsd it should be -lcurses,
   not -lncurses..
 - line-split.c: check that 64k limit is working and not crashing irssi!
 - Some problems with idle notify lists, "cras [IRCNet] [@] [] just stopped
   idling" was print to screen with some NULL arguments in text..
 - /SB GOTO, /SB HOME and /SB END don't set gui->ypos right.
 - When doing a /REHASH, logs are closed?, window logs are entirely removed?
   (also, check that window logs work right if window's refnum changes)
 - theme problems:
    - you can't change theme
    - some small help about what each format does
    - /rehash could re-read them
    - don't keep all themes in memory, just the one in use.
    - use different themes in different channels/queries?
    - logging messages could be printed with a different theme
 - Make /SET HOLD_MODE
 - /CAT should pause on every screenful of text, this should be some kind of
   printtext_multiline_paused() function which would use some callback to
   ask for new text.
 - /msg =dcc_chatti,#kanava doesn't work - fix it somehow that also different
   chat plugins could use the same /msg command. /CTCP too.

 - Better support for copy+pasting text to irssi:
     - detection: first line isn't a /command. next line is followed quickly
       after it, 0.2 sec or something. after pasting is detected, all unknown
       /commands are sent as normal messages.
     - fix copypasting from netscape, strip all spaces at the start and end
       of the line, join multiple lines to one.
 - /NOTIFY -once - notify only once when the user comes to IRC, forget this
   after it.
 - /NOTIFY -comment xxx - add a comment to notify. print the comment when
   user comes to irc.
 - "Should we check people in notify list when you're away" option
 - Implement /EXEC and /ON commands
 - All those options to /WHO and /LIST commands
 - autorun.ircnet

*** Bugs

 - multiple dcc connections from different irc networks from same nick
   doesn't work. Maybe create "server nick" and "refer nick" variables to
   DCC_REC?

*** GTK UI

 - %| doesn't work with irssi text widget
 - some problems when using multiple windows with focus being all the time in
   one of the windows and it can't be changed to different window?! Probably
   has something to do with click to focus.
 - split windows are buggy, destroying them doesn't really work well..
 - mirc ctcp togglemenuitem isn't updated right

*** Big things

 - session saving thing.. specify what channels/queries/dcc chats to open in
   which window (real/tabbed/in same window with some other), what irc net
   channels goes to where, what channels/queries to open at startup, etc.
   use dialog with gtktree widget to change it.
 - some sort of address book? our own irssi ctcp to ask for other irssi users
   for their information (of course not without asking (except optionally))..
   could be nice also to automatically update it, keep track of all seen
   users gathered when joining channels, whois, who, etc. commands.
   automatically updating information could be host masks, nicks, ips, seen in
   channels, operator in channels, .. user specified checks like last topic or
   mode changes or even msgs to you/some channel/with some keyword. great for
   spying people ;) maybe even useful sometimes..

   .. but what database would be best for this?

 - GTK version: icons to toolbars, accelerators to menus
 - Windows style MDI windows are possible with GtkFixed .. Some people would
   like this.. too much job for me, it would need building the MDI windows
   ourself (title bar, borders, resizing, etc.)

 - online help, documentation, ...
 - plugins:
     - scheme, tcl, python scripting? eggdrop/epic compatible scripting?
     - IRC bot, eggdrop is too old, needs a replacement ;) (started)
     - DCC file server, I'm not too excited about this, maybe someone else
       wants to do it..
     - Multiplayer games! :) Chess, tic-tac-toe, othello, battleship, tetris,
       etc. Existing games should probably be used .. though there doesn't
       seem to be any of these (except tetris) for gnome right now..
     - audio / video chat :)

*** Needs rethinking ..

 * Notify list GUI
 - _one_ popup dialog could open which lists all nicks in notifylist, maybe
   sorted by arrival time, display the dates, latest joined could be with
   different color? etc.
 - nick-specific options:
    - pop up the dialog
    - run some command (like /exec as soon as I get that done :)

 * common api for statusbar handling
 - it should work just as well in text mode and gui, colors could be done
   with the normal % formats. GUI just ignores the colors..
 - display number of ops, voices, normals and ircops in statusbar

 * API for creating/modifying menus and toolbar, especially from plugins
 - at least one configurable menu ("usermenu"), or maybe make the whole
   menubar user configurable


*** Little things

 - /savewindows - save the current channel/query positions to file and
   load them at startup.
 - multi-DCC - open multiple sockets to transfer the file
 - autoaway when idling
 - nickserv support (automatic /msg nickserv identify password)
 - itext:
     - save/find text
     - text selection draws the entire selection every time you move the
       mouse...
     - if some other window has got much text, switching to it first time
       takes some time..?
 - editor in setup for ~/.irssi/startup
 - gui help
 - change signal handling in gui-gnome so that the actual drawing and
   functionality are in different signals, so that plugin could change the
   whole look and feel of irssi.
 - currently irssi sends USERHOST commands every now and then to find out
   who are away and who are not.. optionally it could instead just watch if
   someone hasn't written anything to channel in n minutes and mark it "away"
   to nicklist.
 - check new irssi versions with http rather than with irssibot..
 - implement requesting files with DCC GET from remote client for dcc file
   servers. good for people behind firewalls.
 - gnome statubar:
    - clock?
    - dcc transfer meter (gtk progressbar)
 - you could configure which events (whois, notify, etc.) to show in what
   windows (all, current, status, msgs)
 - dcc send: allow selection of multiple files to send (also for dnd from
   gmc!) Allow dropping files to anywhere in irssi.
 - /timer, /clones
 - {}|~ are same as []\^ (not in all irc networks) - does this really affect
   irssi at all..?
