<h3>Q: Why doesn't irssi display colors even when ircii etc. displays them?</h3>

<p>A: They force ANSI colors even if terminal doesn't support them. By
default, irssi uses colors only if terminfo/termcap so says. The correct way
to fix this would be to change your TERM environment to a value where colors
work, like xterm-color or color_xterm. If this doesn't help, then use the
evil way of <code>/SET term_force_colors ON</code>.</p>


<h3>Q: How do I easily write text to channel that starts with '/' character?</h3>

<p>A: <code>/ /text</code></p>


<h3>Q: Why doesn't irssi update my realname (or whatever) after I change it
with <code>/SET realname</code> and reconnect with <code>/RECONNECT</code>
or <code>/SERVER</code>?</h3>

<p>A: Irssi is trying to be too smart. This will be fixed in future, but for
now you should use <code>/DISCONNECT</code> and <code>/CONNECT</code>.</p>


<h3>Q: I connected to some server which isn't responding but now irssi tries
to connect back to it all the time! How can I stop it?</h3>

<p>A: Two ways. The "good way" to do it is with <code>/DISCONNECT</code>.
Check the server tags first with <code>/SERVER</code> without giving it any
parameters, reconnections are those that have tag starting with "recon"
text. So most probably you're going to do <code>/DISCONNECT recon-1</code>.
The other way is to remove all the reconnections with
<code>/RMRECONNS</code>, easier but may remove some connections you actually
wanted to reconnect (if you used multiple servers..).</p>


<h3>Q: How do I add seconds to timestamp?</h3>

<p>A: <code>/FORMAT timestamp {timestamp %%H:%%M:%%S}</code> - and remember
to add the trailing space :)</p>


<h3>Q: Why does irssi say "Irssi: Channel not fully synchronized yet, try
again after a while" when I try to use /BAN etc?</h3>
 
<p>A: Possibly a bug in irssi, or ircd you're using does something that
irssi didn't really notice. The new code should make this happen far less
often than before, but one known reason for this is when irssi doesn't
notice that you were unable to join some channel. Currently however I don't
know of any such events irssi doesn't know about.</p>

<p>Anyway, if this does happen, do <code>/RAWLOG SAVE ~/rawlog</code> soon
after joining to channel, and either try to figure out yourself why irssi
didn't get reply to WHO request, or send the whole log to tss@iki.fi. Note
that the rawlog is by default only 200 lines and it may not be enough to
show all needed information, so you might want to do <code>/SET rawlog_lines
1000</code> or so.</p>

<p><code>MODE +b</code> still works fine though.</p>


<h3>Q: Where's the GUI version?</h3>

<p>A: Read

<h3>Q: How do I autorejoin channels after being kicked?</h3>

<p>A: That's evil and you shouldn't do it. If you get kicked, you should stay
out, at least until the channel forgot you existed :) Most channels I've
joined just ban you if you autorejoin after kick. If you're joined to
channels who kick people for fun, try changing channels or something.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you REALLY want to do that, and you understand that you're doing
evilness, you can use the autorejoin.pl script that comes with irssi. You'll
still need to specify the channels you wish to rejoin with <code>/SET
autorejoin_channels #chan1 #chan2 ...</code></p>


<h3>Q: How do I announce that I'm away/back in all channels I've joined? Or
how do I change my nick when setting myself away/back?</h3>

<p>A: That's even worse than autorejoin. Who could possibly care every time 
you come and go? Many channels will kick you for using this, and I for example
have added several ignores so I'd never need to see these messages. Learn to
use <code>/AWAY</code> command properly and tell it's existence to people
who don't know about it. <code>/WII yournick</code> shows your away reason
much better for people who actually want to know if you're there or not.</p>

<p>You can script these behaviours if you really wish to of course. But
currently there's no public scripts for either of these, and the only way
I'm going to add such to irssi.org is if the script contains a setting to
specify which specific channels the announcement is sent.</p>
