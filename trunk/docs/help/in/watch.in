WATCH %|[[+|-]<nick>][ [+|-]<nick> ...]

Works only in networks using Bahamut ircd.

WATCH is somewhat equal to ISON/NOTIFY, but server-based. With WATCH
server sends status information to client, instead of client sending
ISON's. Therefore WATCH is technically a bit smarter solution than
ISON/NOTIFY. Only disadvantage is WATCH not being "saved" in any way.
Once you disconnect, your WATCH list will get cleared.

WATCH is based on a nick, and must be prepended with a plus ('+') to be
added to your silence list. A minus sign ('-') will remove an entry
from the list. With no arguments, WATCH returns a list of your WATCH
list entries.
