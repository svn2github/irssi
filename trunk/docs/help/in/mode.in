@SYNTAX:mode@

Irssi knows these channel modes:

     i - Invite only - People can't join to channel without being
	 /INVITEd, or being in invite list (+I, see below).
     m - Moderated - People who don't have voices (+v) can't send
	 messages to channel
     p - Private - People who aren't joined to channel can't see it
	 for example with /WHOISing people who are in channel.
     s - Secret - Like private, but the channel isn't displayed in
	 /LIST's output.
     n - No external msgs - Without this mode, anyone can send messages
	 to channel without even being joined.
     t - Topic can be changed only by channel operators.

     k <key> - Channel password (aka. key) - The channel can't be joined
	       without specifying the channel key (see section 6.2).

     l <count> - User limit - No more than <count> people can join to
		 channel. This can be overridden with /INVITE with some
		 servers.

		 This is usually used for protecting channel from join
		 flooding, like some bot allows max. 5 users to join in
		 one minute or so.

     a - Anonymous - No-one's nick name, host or anything else can be
	 seen. All messages, joins, parts, modes, etc. are seen as coming
	 from nick "anonymous", this could be pretty confusing but nice
	 feature if you want total anonymity. This mode can only be set,
	 never unset. This mode isn't supported by all servers.

	 NOTE: there is/was one bug :) Channel operators can guess if some
	 nick might be in the channel and try to kick it. If nick was in
	 channel, everyone will see the nick that was kicked.

     r - Re-op - If channel becomes opless for longer than 45 (?) minutes,
	 op everyone in the channel. This works only in !channels. This
	 mode can only be set, not unset by channel creator.

     b - Set/remove ban. For example MODE #channel +b *!*@*.org bans
	 everyone from .org domain.

	 If someone from .org domain was already in channel before the
	 ban was set, he/she couldn't be able to write any messages to
	 channel (doesn't work with all servers).

	 Ban can also be overridden with /INVITE, although many stupid
	 IRC clients automatically kick the user out because they see
	 the ban and think that because of it the user shouldn't be in
	 the channel (doesn't work with all servers).

     e - Ban exceptions. You could for example ban everyone from
	 *!*@*.org but set ban exception to *!*@*.host.org - works only
	 in IRCnet/EFnet servers.

     I - Invite list. If channel is invite only (+i), people in this
	 list can join it without being /INVITEd - works only in
	 IRCnet/EFnet servers.

	 This is excellent for in-country channels that don't want
	 foreigners (spammers!) to join the channel, for example setting
	 channel's mode to +i and +I *!*@*.fi allows only finnish people
	 to join the channel. In addition to this, there's usually a bot
	 in the channels and sending /MSG bot invite command to it
	 /INVITEs you to the channel.

	 The ':' feature in channel modes is quite similiar, see section
	 6.2.

     O - Channel owner, the nick who creates a !channel receives this
	 mode. It isn't displayed anywhere, you can't pass it to anyone
	 else and you can't regain it again. This is needed for setting
	 +r mode in channel when it's first created.

     o <nick> - Grant or revoke channel operator status from nick
     v <nick> - Grant or revoke voice status from nick, only people with
		+v (or +o) can talk to channel when it's moderated (+m).

You can send multiple mode changes with one mode command:

/MODE #channel +nto-o+v nick1 nick2 nick3

This would set channel's mode to +nt, give ops to nick1, take ops
from nick2 and give voices to nick3.

You can set only limited number of modes that requires argument in
one command. In IRCnet it's 3, in EFnet it's 4 and in many others
it's 6. If it's not known, Irssi defaults to 3. Irssi will also
automatically split them, so you can use /MODE +oooooo n1,n2,..
command to op 6 people and Irssi will split it to two commands in
IRCnet/EFnet.
