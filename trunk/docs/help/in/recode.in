RECODE
    %|List the conversion database

RECODE ADD %|[<target>] <charset>
    %|Add an entry to the conversion database (if target is omitted,
    the current channel or query will be used)

RECODE REMOVE %|[<target>]
    %|Remove an entry from the conversion database (if target is
    omitted, the current channel or query will be used)

To specify your local charset you have to set term_charset

Example:

/SET term_charset <charset>

To see the recode settings: /SET recode

You can change them with /SET 

Examples:

/SET recode_fallback <charset> 
to set the fallback charset for incoming events

This charset will be used when a conversion to 
the defined charset(/recode add) fails or if the 
charset for the target(query or channel) is not set.

/SET recode_out_default_charset <charset> 
to set the global outgoing charset

When it's set to a charset it will be used instead 
of the charset you have defined with /recode add

/SET recode_transliterate ON 
to enable the global transliteration.

The transliteration is based on your locale settings, 
if it doesn't work properly your locale settings may be wrong.
You can enable it per target by adding //TRANSLIT to the <charset>

Hint: <charset> can be almost everything listed by 'iconv -l'
