@SYNTAX:dcc@

This is a command to handle different DCC-connections. DCC is mainly
used for more reliable and faster chatting and for sending and receiving 
files.

/DCC LIST
    - Shows all the open DCC connections.
/DCC RESUME [<nick> [<file>]]
    - Resumes a DCC SEND/GET connection.
/DCC CHAT [<nick>]
    - Sends a chat connection request to remote client or accepts 
      a chat connection if the remote end has already sent a request.
/DCC GET [<nick> [<file>]]
    - Gets the file offered by remote client. The file is downloaded and
      saved into the current working directory.
/DCC SEND [-append | -prepend | -flush | -rmtail | -rmhead]
          <nick> <file> [<file> ...]
    - Sends a DCC SEND request to remote client. Remote end has to accept
      the request before the transmission can be started. Giving multiple files
      queues them. File names may contain shell expansion characters: * ? [] ~
      (~ expansion may not be supported on all platforms). Files with spaces
      in their names need to be quoted (eg. "file name").
/DCC CLOSE <type> <nick> [<file>]
    - Closes a DCC-connection. Type can be either SEND, GET or CHAT.
