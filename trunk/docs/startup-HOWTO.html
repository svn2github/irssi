<h3><a id="c1">1. For all the lazy people</a></h3>

<p>These settings should give you pretty good defaults (the ones I use):</p>

<p>If colors don't work, and you know you're not going to use some
weird non-VT compatible terminal (you most probably aren't), just
say:</p>

<pre>
     /SET term_force_colors ON
</pre>

<p>I don't like automatic query windows, I don't like status window, I do
like msgs window where all messages go:</p>

<pre>
     /SET autocreate_own_query OFF
     /SET autocreate_query_level DCCMSGS
     /SET use_status_window OFF
     /SET use_msgs_window ON
</pre>

<p>Disable automatic window closing when /PARTing channel or /UNQUERYing
query:</p>

<pre>
     /SET autoclose_windows OFF
     /SET reuse_unused_windows ON
</pre>

<p>And example how to add servers:</p>

<p>(openprojects network, identify with nickserv and wait for 2 seconds before
joining channels)</p>

<pre>
     /IRCNET ADD -autosendcmd "/^msg nickserv ident pass;wait -opn 2000" opn
</pre>

<p>Then add some servers to different networks (ircnet is already set up 
for them), irc.kpnqwest.fi is used by default for IRCNet but if it fails,
irc.funet.fi is tried next:</p>

<pre>
     /SERVER ADD -auto -ircnet ircnet irc.kpnqwest.fi 6667
     /SERVER ADD -ircnet ircnet irc.funet.fi 6667
     /SERVER ADD -auto -ircnet efnet efnet.cs.hut.fi 6667
</pre>

<p>Automatically join to channels after connected to server, send op request
to bot after joined to efnet/#irssi:</p>

<pre>
     /CHANNEL ADD -auto #irssi ircnet
     /CHANNEL ADD -auto -bots *!*bot@host.org -botcmd "/^msg $0 op pass"
		  #irssi efnet
</pre>

If you want lines containing your nick to hilight:

<pre>
     /HILIGHT nick
</pre>

<h3><a id="c2">2. Basic user interface usage</a></h3>

<p>Windows can be scrolled up/down with PgUp and PgDown keys. If they don't
work for you, use Meta-p and Meta-n keys. For jumping to beginning or end of
the buffer, use /SB HOME and /SB END commands.</p>

<p>By default, irssi uses "hidden windows" for everything. Hidden
window is created every time you /JOIN a channel or /QUERY someone.
There's several ways you can change between these windows:</p>

<pre>
     Meta-1, Meta-2, .. Meta-0 - Jump directly between windows 1-10
     Meta-q .. Meta-o          - Jump directly between windows 11-19
     /WINDOW &lt;number&gt;          - Jump to any window with specified number
     Ctrl-P, Ctrl-N            - Jump to previous / next window
</pre>

<p>Clearly the easiest way is to use Meta-number keys. And what is the Meta
key? For some terminals, it's the same as ALT. If you have Windows keyboard,
it's probably the left Windows key. If they don't work directly, you'll need
to set a few X resources (NOTE: these work with both xterm and rxvt):</p>   

<pre>
     XTerm*eightBitInput:   false
     XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true
</pre>

<p>With rxvt, you can also specify which key acts as Meta key. So if you
want to use ALT instead of Windows key for it, use:</p>

<pre>
     rxvt*modifier: alt
</pre>

<p>You could do this by changing the X key mappings:</p>

<pre>
    xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L"
</pre>

<p>And how exactly do you set these X resources? For Debian, there's
/etc/X11/Xresources/xterm file where you can put them and it's read 
automatically when X starts. ~/.Xresources and ~/.Xdefaults files might also
work. If you can't get anything else to work, just copy&amp;paste those lines to
~/.Xresources and directly call "xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources" in some xterm.  
The resources affect only the new xterms you start, not existing ones.</p>  

<p>Many windows SSH clients also don't allow usage of ALT. One excellent
client that does allow is putty, you can download it from
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>.</p>

<p>Irssi also supports split windows, they've had some problems in past
but I think they should work pretty well now :) Here's some commands
related to them:</p>

<pre>
     /WINDOW NEW                    - Create new split window
     /WINDOW NEW HIDE               - Create new hidden window
     /WINDOW CLOSE                  - Close split or hidden window

     /WINDOW HIDE [&lt;number&gt;|&lt;name&gt;] - Make the split window hidden window
     /WINDOW SHOW &lt;number&gt;|&lt;name&gt;   - Make the hidden window a split window

     /WINDOW SHRINK [&lt;lines&gt;]       - Shrink the split window
     /WINDOW GROW [&lt;lines&gt;]         - Grow the split window
     /WINDOW BALANCE                - Balance the sizes of all split windows
</pre>

<p>By default, irssi uses "sticky windowing" for split windows. This means
that windows created inside one split window cannot be moved to another
split window without some effort. For example you could have following
window layout:</p>

<pre>
     Split window 1: win#1 - Status window, win#2 - Messages window
     Split window 2: win#3 - ircnet/#channel1, win#4 - ircnet/#channel2
     Split window 3: win#5 - efnet/#channel1, win#6 - efnet/#channel2
</pre>

<p>When you are in win#1 and press ALT-6, irssi jumps to split window
#3 and moves the efnet/#channel2 the active window.</p>

<p>With non-sticky windowing the windows don't have any relationship with
split windows, pressing ALT-6 in win#1 moves win#6 to split window 1
and sets it active, except if win#6 was already visible in some other
split window irssi just changes to that split window. This it the way
windows work with ircii, if you prefer it you can set it with</p>

<pre>
     /SET autostick_split_windows OFF
</pre>

<p>Each window can have multiple channels, queries and other "window
items" inside them. If you don't like windows at all, you disable
automatic creating of them with</p>

<pre>
     /SET autocreate_windows OFF
</pre>

<p>And if you keep all channels in one window, you most probably want
the channel name printed in each line:</p>

<pre>
     /SET print_active_channel ON
</pre>

<p>If you want to group only some channels or queries in one window,
use</p>

<pre>
     /JOIN -window #channel
     /QUERY -window nick
</pre>

<h3><a id="c3">3. Server and channel automation</a></h3>

<p>Irssi's multiple IRC network support is IMHO very good - at least
compared to other clients :) Even if you're only in one IRC network you
should group all your servers to be in the same IRC network as this
helps with reconnecting if your primary server breaks and is probably
useful in some other ways too :) For information how to actually use
irssi correctly with multiple servers see the chapter 6.</p>

<p>First you need to have your IRC network set, use /IRCNET command to
see if it's already there. If it isn't, use /IRCNET ADD yourircnet. To
make Irssi work properly with different IRC networks, you might need to
give some special settings to /IRCNET ADD, see manual.txt for more
information about them. Irssi defaults to IRCNet's behaviour.</p>

<p>After that you need to add your servers. For example:</p>

<pre>
     /SERVER ADD -auto -ircnet ircnet irc.kpnqwest.fi 6667
     /SERVER ADD -auto -ircnet worknet irc.mycompany.com 6667 password
</pre>

<p>The -auto option specifies that this server is automatically connected
at startup. You don't need to make more than one server with -auto
option to one IRC network, other servers are automatically connected in
same network if the -auto server fails.</p>

<p>And finally channels:</p>

<pre>
     /CHANNEL ADD -auto -bots *!*bot@host.org -botcmd "/^msg $0 op pass"
		  #irssi efnet
     /CHANNEL ADD -auto #secret ircnet password
</pre>

<p>-bots and -botcmd should be the only ones needing a bit of
explaining. They're used to send commands automatically to bot when
channel is joined, usually to get ops automatically. You can specify
multiple bot masks with -bots option separated with spaces (and
remember to quote the string then). The $0 in -botcmd specifies the
first found bot in the list. If you don't need the bot masks (ie. the
bot is always with the same nick, like chanserv) you can give only the
-botcmd option and the command is always sent.</p>


<h3><a id="c4">4. Setting up windows and automatically restoring them at startup</a></h3>

<p>First connect to all the servers, join the channels and create the
queries you want. If you want to move the windows or channels around
use commands:</p>

<pre>
     /WINDOW MOVE LEFT/RIGHT/number    - move window elsewhere
     /WINDOW ITEM MOVE &lt;number&gt;|&lt;name&gt; - move channel/query to another window
</pre>

<p>When everything looks the way you like, use /LAYOUT SAVE command
(and /SAVE, if you don't have autosaving enabled) and when you start
irssi next time, irssi remembers the positions of the channels, queries
and everything. This "remembering" doesn't mean that simply using
/LAYOUT SAVE would automatically make irssi reconnect to all servers
and join all channels, you'll need the /SERVER ADD -auto and /CHANNEL
ADD -auto commands to do that.</p>

<p>If you want to change the layout, you just rearrange the layout like
you want it and use /LAYOUT SAVE again. If you want to remove the
layout for some reason, use /LAYOUT RESET.</p>


<h3><a id="c5">5. Status and msgs windows &amp; message levels</a></h3>

<p>By default, all the "extra messages" go to status window. This means
pretty much all messages that don't clearly belong to some channel or
query. Some people like it, some don't. If you want to remove it, use</p>

<pre>
     /SET use_status_window OFF
</pre>

<p>This doesn't have any effect until you restart irssi. If you want to
remove it immediately, just /WINDOW CLOSE it.</p>

<p>Another common window is "messages window", where all private
messages go. By default it's disabled and query windows are created
instead. To make all private messages go to msgs window, say:</p>

<pre>
     /SET use_msgs_window ON
     /SET autocreate_query_level DCCMSGS  (or if you don't want queries to
					   dcc chats either, say NONE)
</pre>

<p>use_msgs_window either doesn't have any effect until restarting
irssi. To create it immediately say:</p>

<pre>
     /WINDOW NEW HIDE     - create the window
     /WINDOW NAME (msgs)  - name it to "(msgs)"
     /WINDOW LEVEL MSGS   - make all private messages go to this window
     /WINDOW MOVE 1       - move it to first window
</pre>

<p>Note that neither use_msgs_window nor use_status_window have any
effect at all if /LAYOUT SAVE has been used.</p>

<p>This brings us to message levels.. What are they? All messages that
irssi prints have one or more "message levels". Most common are PUBLIC
for public messages in channels, MSGS for private messages and CRAP for
all sorts of messages with no real classification. You can get a whole
list of levels with</p>

<pre>
     /HELP levels
</pre>

<p>Status window has message level "ALL -MSGS", meaning that all messages,
except private messages, without more specific place go to status
window. The -MSGS is there so it doesn't conflict with messages
window.</p>


<h3><a id="c6">6. How support for multiple servers works in irssi</a></h3>

<p>ircii and several other clients support multiple servers by placing
the connection into some window. IRSSI DOES NOT. There is no required
relationship between window and server. You can connect to 10 servers
and manage them all in just one window, or join channel in each one of
them to one sigle window if you really want to. That being said, here's
how you do connect to new server without closing the old connection:</p>

<pre>
     /CONNECT irc.server.org
</pre>

<p>Instead of the /SERVER which disconnects the existing connection. To
see list of all active connections, use /SERVER without any parameters.
You should see a list of something like:</p>

<pre>
     -!- IRCNet: irc.song.fi:6667 (IRCNet)
     -!- OPN: tolkien.openprojects.net:6667 (OPN)
     -!- RECON-1: 192.168.0.1:6667 () (02:59 left before reconnecting)
</pre>

<p>Here you see that we're connected to IRCNet and OPN networks. The
the IRCNet at the beginning is called the "server tag" while the
(IRCnet) at the end shows the IRC network. Server tag specifies unique
tag to refer to the server, usually it's the same as the IRC network.
When the IRC network isn't known it's some part of the server name.
When there's multiple connections to same IRC network or server, irssi
adds a number after the tag so there could be ircnet, ircnet2, ircnet3
etc.</p>

<p>Server tags beginning with RECON- mean server reconnections. Above we
see that connection to server at 192.168.0.1 wasn't successful and
irssi will try to connect it again in 3 minutes.</p>

<p>To disconnect one of the servers, or to stop irssi from
reconnecting, use</p>

<pre>
     /DISCONNECT ircnet   - disconnect server with tag "ircnet"
     /DISCONNECT recon-1  - stop trying to reconnect to RECON-1 server
     /RMRECONNS           - stop all server reconnections

     /RECONNECT recon-1   - immediately try reconnecting back to RECON-1
     /RECONNECT ALL       - immediately try reconnecting back to all
			    servers in reconnection queue
</pre>

<p>Now that you're connected to all your servers, you'll have to know how
to specify which one of them you want to use. One way is to have an
empty window, like status or msgs window. In it, you can specify which
server to set active with</p>

<pre>
     /WINDOW SERVER tag    - set server "tag" active
     Ctrl-X                - set the next server in list active
</pre>

<p>When the server is active, you can use it normally. When there's
multiple connected servers, irssi adds [servertag] prefix to all
messages in non-channel/query messages so you'll know where it came
from.</p>

<p>Several commands also accept -servertag option to specify which server
it should use:</p>

<pre>
     /MSG -tag nick message
     /JOIN -tag #channel
     /QUERY -tag nick
</pre>

<p>/MSG tab completion also automatically adds the -tag option when
nick isn't in active server.</p>

<p>Window's server can be made sticky. When sticky, it will never
automatically change to anything else, and if server gets disconnected, the
window won't have any active server. When the server gets connected again,
it is automatically set active in the window. To set the window's server
sticky use</p>

<pre>
     /WINDOW SERVER -sticky tag
</pre>

<p>This is useful if you wish to have multiple status or msgs windows, one
for each server. Here's how to do them (repeat for each server)</p>

<pre>
     /WINDOW NEW HIDE
     /WINDOW NAME (status)
     /WINDOW LEVEL ALL -MSGS
     /WINDOW SERVER -sticky ircnet

     /WINDOW NEW HIDE
     /WINDOW NAME (msgs)
     /WINDOW LEVEL MSGS
     /WINDOW SERVER -sticky ircnet
</pre>

<h3><a id="c7">7. /LASTLOG and jumping around in scrollback</a></h3>

<p>/LASTLOG command can be used for searching texts in scrollback
buffer. Simplest usages are</p>

<pre>
     /LASTLOG word     - print all lines with "word" in them
     /LASTLOG word 10  - print last 10 occurances of "word"
     /LASTLOG -topics  - print all topic changes
</pre>

<p>If there's more than 1000 lines to be printed, irssi thinks that you
probably made some mistake and won't print them without -force option.
If you want to save the full lastlog to file, use</p>

<pre>
     /LASTLOG -file ~/irc.log
</pre>

<p>With -file option you don't need -force even if there's more than 1000
lines. /LASTLOG has a lot of other options too, see /HELP lastlog for
details.</p>

<p>Once you've found the lines you were interested in, you might want
to check the discussion around them. Irssi has /SCROLLBACK (or alias
/SB) command for jumping around in scrollback buffer. Since /LASTLOG
prints the timestamp when the message was originally printed, you can
use /SB GOTO hh:mm to jump directly there. To get back to the bottom of
scrollback, use /SB END command.</p>


<h3><a id="c8">8. Logging</a></h3>

<p>Irssi can automatically log important messages when you're set away
(/AWAY reason). When you set yourself unaway (/AWAY), the new messages
in away log are printed to screen. You can configure it with:</p>

<pre>
     /SET awaylog_level MSGS HILIGHT     - Specifies what messages to log
     /SET awaylog_file ~/.irssi/away.log - Specifies the file to use
</pre>

<p>Easiest way to start logging with Irssi is to use autologging. With it
Irssi logs all channels and private messages to specified directory.
You can turn it on with</p>

<pre>
     /SET autolog ON
</pre>

<p>By default it logs pretty much everything execept CTCPS or CRAP
(/WHOIS requests, etc). You can specify the logging level yourself with</p>

<pre>
     /SET autolog_level ALL -CRAP -CLIENTCRAP -CTCPS (this is the default)
</pre>

<p>By default irssi logs to ~/irclogs/&lt;servertag&gt;/&lt;target&gt;.log.
You can change this with</p>

<pre>
     /SET autolog_path ~/irclogs/$tag/$0.log (this is the default)
</pre>

<p>The path is automatically created if it doesn't exist. $0 specifies
the target (channel/nick). You can make irssi automatically rotate the
logs by adding date/time formats to the file name. The formats are in
"man strftime" format. For example</p>

<pre>
     /SET autolog_path ~/irclogs/%Y/$tag/$0.%m-%d.log
</pre>

<p>For logging only some specific channels or nicks, see /HELP log</p>


<h3><a id="c9">9. Changing keyboard bindings</a></h3>

<p>You can change any keyboard binding that terminal lets irssi know
about. It doesn't let irssi know everything, so for example
shift-backspace can't be bound unless you modify xterm resources
somehow.</p>

<p>/HELP bind tells pretty much everything there is to know about
keyboard bindings. However, there's the problem of how to bind some
non-standard keys. They might differ a bit with each terminal, so
you'll need to find out what exactly the keypress produces. Easiest
way to check that would be to see what it prints in "cat". Here's
an example for pressing F1 key:</p>

<pre>
[cras@hurina] ~% cat
^[OP
</pre>

<p>So in irssi you would use /BIND ^[OP /ECHO F1 pressed. If you use
multiple terminals which have different bindings for the key, it would
be better to use eg.:</p>

<pre>
/BIND ^[OP key F1
/BIND ^[11~ key F1
/BIND F1 /ECHO F1 pressed.
</pre>

<h3><a id="c10">10. Proxies and IRC bouncers</a></h3>

<p>Irssi supports connecting to IRC servers via a proxy. All server
connections are then made through it, and if you've set up everything
properly, you don't need to do any /QUOTE SERVER commands manually.</p>

<p>Here's an example: You have your bouncer (lets say, BNC or BNC-like)
listening in irc.bouncer.org port 5000. You want to use it to connect
to servers irc.dalnet and irc.efnet.org. First you'd need to setup the
bouncer:</p>

<pre>
     /SET use_proxy ON
     /SET proxy_address irc.bouncer.org
     /SET proxy_port 5000

     /SET proxy_password YOUR_BNC_PASSWORD_HERE
     /SET -clear proxy_string
     /SET proxy_string_after conn %s %d
</pre>

<p>Then you'll need to add the server connections. These are done
exactly as if you'd want to connect directly to them. Nothing special
about them:</p>

<pre>
     /SERVER ADD -auto -ircnet dalnet irc.dal.net
     /SERVER ADD -auto -ircnet efnet irc.efnet.org
</pre>

<p>With the proxy /SETs however, irssi now connects to those servers
through your BNC. All server connections are made through them so you
can just forget that your bouncer even exists.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use the proxy for some reason, there's -noproxy
option which you can give to /SERVER and /SERVER ADD commands.</p>

<p><strong>Proxy specific settings:</strong></p>

<p>All proxies have these settings in common:</p>

<pre>
     /SET use_proxy ON
     /SET proxy_address &lt;Proxy host address&gt;
     /SET proxy_port &lt;Proxy port&gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>HTTP proxy</strong></p>

<p>Use these settings with HTTP proxies:</p>

<pre>
     /SET -clear proxy_password
     /EVAL SET proxy_string CONNECT %s:%d\n\n
</pre>

<p><strong>BNC</strong></p>

<pre>
     /SET proxy_password your_pass
     /SET -clear proxy_string
     /SET proxy_string_after conn %s %d
</pre>

<p><strong>dircproxy</strong></p>

<p>dircproxy separates the server connections by passwords. So, if you
for example have ircnet connection with password ircpass and
openprojects connection with opnpass, you would do something like
this:</p>

<pre>
     /SET -clear proxy_password
     /SET -clear proxy_string

     /SERVER ADD -auto -ircnet ircnet fake.ircnet 6667 ircpass
     /SERVER ADD -auto -ircnet opn fake.opn 6667 opnpass
</pre>

<p>The server name and port you give isn't used anywhere, so you can
put anything you want in there.</p>

<p><strong>psyBNC</strong></p>

<p>psyBNC has internal support for multiple servers. However, it could
be a bit annoying to use, and some people just use different users for
connecting to different servers. You can manage this in a bit same way
as with dircproxy, by creating fake connections:</p>

<pre>
    /SET -clear proxy_password
    /SET -clear proxy_string

    /IRCNET ADD -user ircnetuser ircnet
    /SERVER ADD -auto -ircnet ircnet fake.ircnet 6667 ircpass
    /IRCNET ADD -user opnuser opn
    /SERVER ADD -auto -ircnet opn fake.opn 6667 opnpass
</pre>

<p>So, you'll specify the usernames with /IRCNET ADD command, and the
user's password with /SERVER ADD.</p>

<p><strong>Irssi proxy</strong></p>

<p>Irssi contains it's own proxy which you can build giving
<strong>--with-proxy</strong> option to configure. You'll still need to run
irssi in a screen to use it though.</p>

<p>Irssi proxy is a bit different than most proxies, normally proxies create
a new connection to IRC server when you connect to it, but with irssi proxy
all the clients use the same IRC server connection (a bit like how screen -x
works).</p>

<p>Irssi proxy supports sharing multiple server connections in different
ports, like you can share ircnet in port 2777 and efnet in port 2778.</p>

<p>Usage in proxy side:</p>

<pre>
     /LOAD proxy
     /SET irssiproxy_password &lt;password&gt;
     /SET irssiproxy_ports &lt;ircnet&gt;=&lt;port&gt; ... (eg. ircnet=2777 efnet=2778)
</pre>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: you <strong>MUST</strong> add all the servers you
are using to server and ircnet lists with /SERVER ADD and /IRCNET ADD.
..Except if you really don't want to for some reason, and you only use
one server connection, you may simply set:</p>

<pre>
     /SET irssiproxy_ports *=2777
</pre>

<p>Usage in client side:</p>

<p>Just connect to the irssi proxy like it is a normal server with password
specified in /SET irssiproxy_password. For example:</p>

<pre>
     /SERVER ADD -ircnet ircnet my.irssi-proxy.org 2777 secret
     /SERVER ADD -ircnet efnet my.irssi-proxy.org 2778 secret
</pre>

<p>Irssi proxy works fine with other IRC clients as well.</p>

<p><strong>SOCKS</strong></p>

Irssi can be compiled with socks support (<strong>--with-socks</strong>
option to configure), but I don't really know how it works, if at all. /SET
proxy settings don't have anything to do with socks however.

<p><strong>Others</strong></p>

<p>IRC bouncers usually work like IRC servers, and want a password. You can
give it with:</p>

<pre>
     /SET proxy_password &lt;password&gt;
</pre>

<p>Irssi's defaults for connect strings are</p>

<pre>
     /SET proxy_string CONNECT %s %d
     /SET proxy_string_after
</pre>

<p>The proxy_string is sent before NICK/USER commands, the
proxy_string_after is sent after them. %s and %d can be used with both
of them.</p>

<h3><a id="c11">11. Irssi's settings</a></h3>

<p>You probably don't like Irssi's default settings. I don't like them.
But I'm still convinced that they're pretty good defaults. Here's some
of them you might want to change (the default value is shown):</p>

<p><strong>Queries</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>/SET autocreate_own_query ON</dt>
  <dd>Should new query window be created when you send message to someone
  (with /msg).</dd>

<dt>/SET autocreate_query_level MSGS</dt>
  <dd>New query window should be created when receiving messages with
  this level. MSGS, DCCMSGS and NOTICES levels work currently. You can
  disable this with /SET -clear autocrate_query_level.</dd>

<dt>/SET autoclose_query 0</dt>
  <dd>Query windows can be automatically closed after certain time of
  inactivity. Queries with unread messages aren't closed and active
  window is neither never closed. The value is given in seconds.</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>/SET use_msgs_window OFF</dt>
  <dd>Create messages window at startup. All private messages go to this
  window. This only makes sense if you've disabled automatic query
  windows. Message window can also be created manually with /WINDOW LEVEL
  MSGS, /WINDOW NAME (msgs).</dd>

<dt>/SET use_status_window ON</dt>
  <dd>Create status window at startup. All messages that don't really
  have better place go here, like all /WHOIS replies etc. Status window
  can also be created manually with /WINDOW LEVEL ALL -MSGS, /WINDOW NAME
  (status).</dd>

<dt>/SET autocreate_windows ON</dt>
  <dd>Should we create new windows for new window items or just place
  everything in one window</dd>

<dt>/SET autoclose_windows ON</dt>
  <dd>Should window be automatically closed when the last item in them is
  removed (ie. /PART, /UNQUERY).</dd>

<dt>/SET reuse_unused_windows OFF</dt>
  <dd>When finding where to place new window item (channel, query) Irssi
  first tries to use already existing empty windows. If this is set ON,
  new window will always be created for all window items. This setting is
  ignored if autoclose_windows is set ON.</dd>

<dt>/SET window_auto_change OFF</dt>
  <dd>Should Irssi automatically change to automatically created windows
  - usually queries when someone sends you a message. To prevent
  accidentally sending text meant to some other channel/nick, Irssi
  clears the input buffer when changing the window. The text is still in
  scrollback buffer, you can get it back with pressing arrow up key.</dd>

<dt>/SET print_active_channel OFF</dt>
  <dd>When you keep more than one channel in same window, Irssi prints
  the messages coming to active channel as &quot;&lt;nick&gt; text&quot;
  and other channels as &quot;&lt;nick:channel&gt; text&quot;. If this
  setting is set ON, the messages to active channels are also printed in
  the latter way.</dd>

<dt>/SET window_history OFF</dt>
  <dd>Should command history be kept separate for each window.</dd>
</dl>


<p><strong>User information</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>/SET nick</dt>
  <dd>Your nick name</dd>

<dt>/SET alternate_nick</dt>
  <dd>Your alternate nick.</dd>

<dt>/SET user_name</dt>
  <dd>Your username, if you have ident enabled this doesn't affect 
  anything</dd>

<dt>/SET real_name</dt>
  <dd>Your real name.</dd>
</dl>


<p><strong>Server information</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>/SET skip_motd OFF</dt>
  <dd>Should we hide server's MOTD (Message Of The Day).</dd>

<dt>/SET server_reconnect_time 300</dt>
  <dd>Seconds to wait before connecting to same server again. Don't set
  this too low since it usually doesn't help at all - if the host is
  down, the few extra minutes of waiting won't hurt much.</dd>

<dt>/SET lag_max_before_disconnect 300</dt>
  <dd>Maximum server lag in seconds before disconnecting and trying to
  reconnect. This happens mostly only when network breaks between you and
  IRC server.</dd>
</dl>


<p><strong>Appearance</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>/SET timestamps ON</dt>
  <dd>Show timestamps before each message.</dd>

<dt>/SET hide_text_style OFF</dt>
  <dd>Hide all bolds, underlines, MIRC colors, etc.</dd>

<dt>/SET show_nickmode ON</dt>
  <dd>Show the nick's mode before nick in channels, ie. ops have
  &lt;@nick&gt;, voices &lt;+nick&gt; and others &lt;&nbsp;nick&gt;</dd>

<dt>/SET show_nickmode_empty ON</dt>
  <dd>If the nick doesn't have a mode, use one space. ie. ON:
  &lt;&nbsp;nick&gt;, OFF: &lt;nick&gt;</dd>

<dt>/SET show_quit_once OFF</dt>
  <dd>Show quit message only once in some of the channel windows the
  nick was in instead of in all windows.</dd>

<dt>/SET lag_min_show 100</dt>
  <dd>Show the server lag in status bar if it's bigger than this, the
  unit is 1/100 of seconds (ie. the default value of 100 = 1 second).</dd>

<dt>/SET indent 10</dt>
  <dd>When lines are longer than screen width they have to be split to
  multiple lines. This specifies how much space to put at the beginning
  of the line before the text begins. This can be overridden in text
  formats with %| format.</dd>

<dt>/SET activity_hide_targets</dt>
  <dd>If you don't want to see window activity in some certain channels
  or queries, list them here. For example "#boringchannel =bot1 =bot2".
  If any highlighted text or message for you appears in that window, this
  setting is ignored and the activity is shown.</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Nick completion</strong></p>

<dl>
<dt>/SET completion_auto OFF</dt>
  <dd>Automatically complete the nick if line begins with start of nick
  and the completion character. Learn to use the tab-completion instead,
  it's a lot better ;)</dd>

<dt>/SET completion_char :</dt>
  <dd>Completion character to use.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a id="c12">12. Statusbar</a></h3>

<p><strong>/STATUSBAR</strong> displays a list of statusbars:</p>

<pre>
Name                           Type   Placement Position Visible
window                         window bottom    0        always
window_inact                   window bottom    1        inactive
prompt                         root   bottom    100      always
topic                          root   top       1        always
</pre>

<p><strong>/STATUSBAR &lt;name&gt;</strong> prints the statusbar
settings and it's items. <strong>/STATUSBAR &lt;name&gt;
ENABLE|DISABLE</strong> enables/disables the statusbar.
<strong>/STATUSBAR &lt;name&gt; RESET</strong> resets the statusbar to
it's default settings, or if the statusbar was created by you, it will be
removed.</p>

<p>Type can be window or root, meaning if the statusbar should be
created for each split window, or just once. Placement can be top or
bottom. Position is a number, the higher the value the lower in screen
it is. Visible can be always, active or inactive. Active/inactive is
useful only with split windows, one split window is active and the rest
are inactive. These settings can be changed with:</p>

<ul>
<li>STATUSBAR &lt;name&gt; TYPE window|root</li>
<li>STATUSBAR &lt;name&gt; PLACEMENT top|bottom</li>
<li>STATUSBAR &lt;name&gt; POSITION &lt;num&gt;</li>
<li>STATUSBAR &lt;name&gt; VISIBLE always|active|inactive</li>
</ul>

<p>When loading a new statusbar scripts, you'll need to also specify
where you want to show it. Statusbar items can be modified with:</p>

<ul>
<li>10:52 STATUSBAR &lt;name&gt; ADD [-before | -after &lt;item&gt;] [-priority #] [-alignment left|right] &lt;item&gt;</li>
<li>10:52 STATUSBAR &lt;name&gt; REMOVE &lt;item&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>The item name with statusbar scripts is usually same as the script's
name. Script's documentation should tell if this isn't the case. So, to
add mail.pl before the window activity item (see the list with
/STATUSBAR window), use: <strong>/STATUSBAR window ADD -before act
mail</strong>.</p>
